Hi! I'm Kerrick.

I live in [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn) and am a software engineer at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/). I spend a lot of time learning Mandarin, rock climbing, working on [open source projects](https://github.com/kerrickstaley), and thinking about data science, transit, and effective government.
