Hi! I'm Kerrick.

I live in [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) and am a data scientist at [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/). I spend a lot of time learning Mandarin, rock climbing, working on [open source projects](https://github.com/kerrickstaley), and thinking about machine learning, data science, and effective government.
