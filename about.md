Hi! I'm Kerrick.

I live in [Hoboken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey) and am a software engineer at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/). I spend a lot of time learning Mandarin, rock climbing, working on [open source projects](https://github.com/kerrickstaley), and thinking about machine learning, data science, and effective government.
