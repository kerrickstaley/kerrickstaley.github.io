Hi! I'm Kerrick.

I live in [Cambridge, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts). I spend a lot of time learning Mandarin, rock climbing, working on [open source projects](https://github.com/kerrickstaley), and thinking about machine learning, data science, 3D printing, and mass transit.
