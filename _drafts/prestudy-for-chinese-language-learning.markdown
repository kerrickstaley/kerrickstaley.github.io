Learning Chinese is hard. I took Mandarin for 5 semesters in university but left with a fairly rudimentary understanding of the language. After graduating, I discovered [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which is an open source [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) flashcard app. Spaced repetition is a technique for efficiently memorizing large amounts of information (for example, you could use it to learn vocabulary in a new language, body parts for an anatomy class, or reactions in organic chemistry). Anki is perhaps the most popular spaced repetition software, and using it gave a huge boost to my language acquisition. I still use it almost daily.
